I’m a [WASP](https://wasp-sweden.org/) PhD student at the Division of Statistics and Machine Learning at Linköping University, Sweden. My supervisors are [Fredrik Lindsten](https://lindsten.netlify.app/) and [Tomas Landelius](https://www.smhi.se/en/research/research-departments/meteorology/tomas-landelius-1.4817).

My main research interest is in probabilistic spatio-temporal modeling with applications in the physical sciences. In particular, I'm interested in applying tools from generative modelling to weather forecasting and data assimilation. 

I have a BSc in Engineering Physics and a MSc in Applied Mathematics both from KTH. 

Outside of work I enjoy rock climbing both in- and outdoors.

Don't hesitate to reach out if you want to chat about research or climb together!
